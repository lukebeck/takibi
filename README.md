==============

Takibi is a cli flashcard application. It only has basic functionality and no error messaging.

ðŸ”¥ Installing
----------

Install takibi in a location that you can easily access, as adding new words is done through editing `takibi/db/import.csv`.

To install takibi, download it and then in the top directory run:

`pip3 install -e .`

Then you can call it from the command line with `takibi`.

To test takibi after installing, run the program and try importing the test word added to the `import.csv` file.

ðŸ”¥ Usage
-----

To use takibi, call it from the command line along:

`takibi`

This will load the menu, which gives you 4 options:

1. **Study** â€” begin a study session for any cards that require review.
2. **Save** â€” save the deck in its current state to the database (`db.csv`).
3. **Import** â€” import cards from `import.csv` then clear `import.csv`.
4. **Quit** â€” save and quit the application.

To add new words to takibi, enter them into `import.csv` then import them from the takibi application.
